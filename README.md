# Kaprekar-constant
 
A small python script that brute-forces numbers between 1000 and 9999 (incluced) 
to see if the kaprekar routine always leads to the number 6174 (it does.)

It also outputs some data about the calculations (you can see them already computed in the [results](results.txt) file)

You can also see some observations I had at the end of the [main](main.py) file

The [results](results.txt) file was generated using `output_order=1`
